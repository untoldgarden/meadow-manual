# Welcome to the Meadow Manual

Meadow is a social platform for creating, publishing and distributing XR experiences. The platform allows you to upload Asset Bundles from Unity straight to the Meadow platform, to be available to anyone with the app installed. It saves you having to create a bespoke app, and lets you focus on the fun of creating your experiences.

Meadow is currently in a closed beta, but we're always looking for new use cases. [Contact us if you are interested in using it.](mailto:studio@untold.garden)
