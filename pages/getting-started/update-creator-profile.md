# Update Your Creator Profile

Your creator profile on Meadow is a public-facing page that showcases your work and helps you connect with other creators. It shows all your public experiences, and can be used by your audience to find your work.

A creator profile is currently subject to approval by the Meadow team, to ensure that the content is appropriate for the platform. 

Please send us a message if you'd like to be public, and we'll get to it straight away. Please first update your profile with a user name, profile picture and a short bio.

## Update Your Profile

1. Go to the [Meadow console](https://console.meadow.space/).
2. Log in with your Meadow account.
3. Click on your profile picture in the top right corner.
