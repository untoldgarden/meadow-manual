## Installing Unity {#installing-unity}

Your Unity installs and projects are managed through an application called Unity Hub. You need to download this software to install and use Unity. Itâ€™s similar to Adobe Creative Cloud.



1. Download Unity hub from [https://unity.com/download](https://unity.com/download)
2. Install it
3. Open the Hub, create an account, and login
4. Install an editor (Unity publishes new versions weekly). You can install the latest suggested version for Unity 6000.0 (We do not currently recommend versions 6000.1), but make sure it's Unity 6 as older versions will not work with Meadow. If you plan to use visual effects and/or shader graph make sure to download 6000.0.1, as newer versions might not display the effects correctly.

5. When prompted, install iOS and Android modules. At the moment both are needed even if you only plan on building for one platform.

6. Get a license. Use the free personal one. You do **not** need to use the PRO version to use Meadow.
