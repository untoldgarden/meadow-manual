## Installing Unity {#installing-unity}

Your Unity installs and projects are managed through an application called Unity Hub. You need to download this software to install and use Unity. Itâ€™s similar to Adobe Creative Cloud.



1. Download Unity hub from [https://unity.com/download](https://unity.com/download)
2. Install it
3. Open the Hub, create an account, and login
4. Install an editor (Unity publishes new versions weekly). You can install the latest suggested version, but make sure it's Unity 6 or newer. (Support for older version is not guaranteed.)

5. When prompted, install iOS and Android modules. At the moment both are needed even if you only plan on building for one platform.

6. Get a license. Use the free personal one. You do **not** need to a PRO Unity License to use Meadow.
