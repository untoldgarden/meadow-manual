# Earnings Dashboard

Your central hub for tracking revenue, managing transactions, and processing payouts.

![Monetization settings overview](../images/monetisation/earnings.png "Monetization Settings Overview")

## Revenue Overview

The dashboard displays three key financial metrics:

**Available Balance** shows funds ready for immediate payout to your bank account (after the 10% platform fee is deducted).

**Pending Balance** includes recent transactions still being processed by Stripe (2-7 days) or cryptocurrency confirmations.

**Total Earnings** displays your cumulative revenue for any selected time period with gross/net breakdown and transaction count.

## Initial Setup

Follow the guide on [dashboard earnings](https://app.meadow.space/dashboard/earnings) page


## Tracking Performance

View earnings trends through interactive charts with daily, weekly, monthly, or custom date range options. The charts help identify peak performance periods and growth patterns.


The currency reflects your Stripe Connect account.

## Transaction History

View detailed records of all sales including timestamp, experience name, edition number, payment method, and financial breakdown (gross amount, platform fee, net earnings).

Transaction status indicators show whether payments are succeeded, pending, failed, disputed, or refunded.

## Payouts

Until funds settle, the balance will remain pending. Standard transfers take 3-5 business days, while international wires may take 5-10 business days.
The settled funds will pe payed to your account daily.

### Stripe Integration

Access your full Stripe Connect dashboard with one click for advanced analytics, fraud monitoring, and financial documents including monthly statements and tax forms.


## Getting Paid

### Stripe Account Setup

Complete business verification to receive payments by providing:
- Business information (type, tax ID, address)
- Bank account details for payouts
- Identity verification documents
- Tax forms (W-9, W-8BEN, etc.)


## Common Issues

**Payout Delays:** Usually caused by bank holidays, pending account verification, or balances below minimum thresholds.

**Transaction Disputes:** Handle customer chargebacks through the dispute resolution process with evidence submission.

**Technical Issues:** Clear browser cache for loading problems or contact support for data synchronization issues.
