# Monetization Settings

Transform your digital experience into a revenue-generating asset by configuring pricing, payment methods, and delivery options.

![Monetization settings overview](../images/monetisation/monetisation-settings.png "Monetization Settings Overview")


## Getting Started

To begin selling your experience, navigate to your experience settings and toggle on the monetization option. This unlocks all revenue features including pricing controls, payment processing, and certificate generation.

⚠️ **WARNING: Once monetization is enabled on a public experience:**

• You cannot disable monetization
• You cannot edit monetization settings  
• You cannot make the experience private
• You cannot delete the experience


## Pricing & Editions

### Set Your Price

Choose your base price in EUR, GBP, or USD. This is the amount buyers pay and what you earn before the **10% platform fee** (which covers payment processing and platform maintenance).
*Reasles have a reduced **5% platform fee**


### Limited Editions

Create scarcity and collector value. Set a total count (1-1000 items) and each buyer receives a numbered edition. Perfect for NFT collectors and exclusive releases.


## Payment Methods

Choose how buyers can pay for your experience:

**Credit Card (Stripe)** offers the widest accessibility with familiar checkout process and instant payment confirmation. Best for reaching mainstream audiences.

**Buyer's Choice** allows both credit card and cryptocurrency payments, maximizing your market reach. Crypto payments automatically generate NFTs on the blockchain. ([MetaMask wallet](https://metamask.io/) required)

<!-- **NFT Only** restricts purchases to cryptocurrency transactions, appealing to blockchain enthusiasts but requiring buyers to have crypto wallets and pay gas fees. -->

## Certificates

**Physical certificates** will be added to editions at additional price depending on the buyer's location, professionally printed through our global pratner's network and delivered within 5-10 business days.

## Map Placement

**Map Placement** allows buyers to mark their location on your experience map (default limit: 3 locations per buyer). This builds community and provides social proof of global ownership.

Physical certificate shipping is available worldwide through our Gelato integration, with automatic cost calculation and full tracking information.

## Setup Process

1. **Enable monetization** in your experience settings
2. **Set pricing** and choose edition type
3. **Configure payment methods** and connect Stripe if needed
4. **Select certificate templates** and shipping options
5. **Test the purchase process** before going live
