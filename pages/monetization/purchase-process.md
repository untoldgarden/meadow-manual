# Purchase Process

Understanding how buyers experience purchasing your monetized experiences helps you optimize conversion and customer satisfaction.

## Buyer Journey

### Purchase Dialog

Buyers can purchase the cheapest edition by clicking the *Get* button or choose a specific edition from the Editions Dialog.

**Payment Methods:**
- **Credit Card:** Standard Stripe checkout with wide acceptance
- **Cryptocurrency:** MetaMask integration with automatic NFT minting
- **Buyer's Choice:** When both options are enabled


## Payment Flow

The checkout provides complete price showing:
- Price: base price + platform fee (10% on inital sales and 5% on resales) + certificate costs
- Shipping: shipping costs

## After Purchase

Buyers get instant access to the purchased experience in their collection.

### Certificate Delivery

**Digital certificates** are delivered instantly as high-resolution PDF files with a unique verification number.

**Physical certificates** follow a 5-10 day production and shipping process through our partner's global network, with tracking updates and quality assurance.
