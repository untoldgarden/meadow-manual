## Upload to Meadow

1. Open the experience you would like to upload to.
2. In the drop down `Asset Bundle`, select the bundle you would like to upload. This is the bundle that you assigned to your project folder. [See instructions here.](https://manual.meadow.space/upload-to-meadow.html#add-your-files-to-an-asset-bundle)
3. Specify if this is the Experience Bundle or the Map Marker Bundle. [See Map Marker instructions here.](https://manual.meadow.space/map-marker.html)
4. Select the platforms for which you would like to upload the experience.
5. Click <b style="color: #559859;">Upload to Meadow</b>.
6. The process takes a while the first time it's done as Unity has some caching to do. Subsequent uploads will be faster.
