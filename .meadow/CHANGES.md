## How to Verify It Works

### Local Testing
1. **Build the site**:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```
2. **Open in browser**: Navigate to http://localhost:4000

### Feature Verification
1. **Search Feature**:
   - Press CMD+K (Mac) or Ctrl+K (Windows/Linux) to open search
   - Type any term to see instant results
   - Use arrow keys to navigate results
   - Press Enter to go to selected result
   - Click outside or press Escape to close

2. **Responsive Design**:
   - Resize browser window to test mobile layout
   - Click hamburger menu on mobile to open sidebar
   - Verify all content is readable on small screens

3. **Navigation**:
   - Check breadcrumbs appear on all pages except home
   - Verify Previous/Next navigation at bottom of pages
   - Confirm sidebar shows active page highlighting

4. **Code Features**:
   - Hover over code blocks to see copy button
   - Click copy button to copy code to clipboard
   - Click on images to open in lightbox

## Technical Notes

- Site is built with Jekyll 4.3.2
- Search uses Lunr.js 2.3.9 for client-side indexing
- All modern browsers supported (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile responsive down to 320px width
- Accessibility improvements with better color contrast and keyboard navigation

## Performance Impact

- Search index is generated at build time (no runtime overhead)
- JavaScript is minimal and loads asynchronously
- CSS is optimized with custom properties for smaller file size
- Images lazy load for better initial page load

The manual now follows industry-standard documentation design patterns similar to GitHub Docs, Stripe Docs, and other modern documentation sites.
