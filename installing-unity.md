## Installing Unity {#installing-unity}

Your Unity installs and projects are managed through an application called Unity Hub. You need to download this software to install and use Unity. Itâ€™s similar to Adobe Creative Cloud.



1. Download Unity hub from [https://unity.com/download](https://unity.com/download)
2. Install it
3. Open the Hub, create an account, and login
4. Install an editor (Unity publishes new versions weekly. You can install the one suggested, 2022.3.11f1, but if you plan to use it for visual effects you need 2022.3.7f1 for compatibility reasons)
5. When prompted, install iOS and/or Android modules, depending on which platform you plan to build for.

6. Get a license. Use the free personal one. You do **not** need to use the PRO version to use Meadow.
